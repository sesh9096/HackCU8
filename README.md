# HackCU8 Project "Running Horcruxes"

<!---
ReadMe File

Project Ideas: Game, Phaser?

Themes: magic, Harry Potter
-->
Using the pygame library, this is a game written entirely in Python based on the theme of magic for HackCU8. The goal of this game is to catch all "horcruxes" before time runs out. Running off the edge of the map will cause you to move to the next realm.

Difficulty is added by the tendency of horcuxes to run away from the player.

<!--- If this game looks low quality, it was because it was made in a day by 2 people who had no experience with the pygame library before.-->
